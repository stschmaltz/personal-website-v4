# Shane Schmaltz's Personal Website (Temporary Version)

## Overview

This is a temporary landing page for my personal website that I crafted with Svelte! It serves as a placeholder while I work on a fancier version, my old site was getting very out of date.

## Features

- **Created with Svelte:** Utilizes the innovative and reactive Svelte framework for a lightweight and efficient user experience.
- **Professional Background:** Provides insights into my current role, past experiences, and my journey within the tech industry.
- **Tech Stack:** Outlines the programming languages, frameworks, and tools I specialize in.
- **Side Projects:** Highlights a selection of personal projects showcasing my interests and skills.
- **Hobbies:** Offers a glimpse into what I enjoy outside of my professional life.

## Project Status

This website is a temporary version designed to share a snapshot of my professional profile and personal interests while the comprehensive update to my site is underway. The upcoming version will more fully reflect my recent projects, technical skills, and the work I'm passionate about. Stay tuned for the full site's launch!
